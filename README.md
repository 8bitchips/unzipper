## UnZipper

The Unzipper extracts .zip or .rar archives and .gz files on webservers.
It's handy if you do not have shell access. E.g. if you want to upload a lot
of files (php framework or image collection) as an archive to save time. As of version 0.1.0 it also supports creating archives.
 

## How to use:
- upload the zip/rar/tarz file to the server.
- upload unzipper.php to public_html or desired directory.
- access the site ex: https://stellarshank.000webhostapp.com/unzipper.php.
- select the destination to extract
- Voil√† you extracted your files.
